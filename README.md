# Reflection
This is the Reflection for Computer Science Signature Work for my time at the University of St. Thomas! In this reflection I will cover three projects that while my not be my best work, have been important to me as a developer and have allowed me to grow and learn. I will go over the three projects in no particular order and touch on what made them so important to me as a developer and my thoughts and opinions of how they turned out, I hope you enjoy!

1. Personal Portfolio.
   https://github.com/DaltonSchwanke/Portfolio
   This is my first real attempt at a portfolio website. It is a single page application that contains a nice welcome message, a projects section, experience section, about, and contact. The user can then navigate down the page and view the various projects and experiences via acyclic carousels. At the bottom of the page there is a contact form which the user can enter in their email, and message in order to contact me. This project never got completed, and I stopped developing it after I found a better way to create a portfolio which started development on December 4, 2024.  
   While it wasn't my first it was the first half decent attempt at a portfolio and contained most of the required elements for a website. It taught me a lot about page dynamics, and also element create within javascript as opposed to have static elements in a html page whether it's a template or not. On top of that it gave me a brief understanding of user authentification, something I precieve to be incredibly useful in some of my other projects. While this definitly isn't my best work it is worth mentioning that there are aspects of this website that's sole purpose was for experimentation. I learned how to layer a website so that I could add in a animated background. I took time to learn about anchor tags and how to set scroll functions that would allow me to control the user's scrolling capabilities; In this instance, it makes it so that the user moves to the next section and there is true scrolling to any point on the y axis.
