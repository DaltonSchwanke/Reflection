# Reflection
This is the Reflection for Computer Science Signature Work for my time at the University of St. Thomas! In this reflection I will cover three projects that while my not be my best work, have been important to me as a developer and have allowed me to grow and learn. I will go over the three projects in no particular order and touch on what made them so important to me as a developer and my thoughts and opinions of how they turned out, I hope you enjoy!

1. Simple Calculator
   https://github.com/DaltonSchwanke/Simple-Calculator

   This project is a simple calculator that contains basic calculator functions, and it sits on top of a background containing circles of varying size and opacity. The user can click and drag the calculator to any point in the window, and enter in expressions and then get the result by hitting the '=' button. 

   My simple calculator is a simple but fun take on a calculator website. While this one is nothing special this marks the time when I started to appreciate web developement and javascript as a whole. I created this as an assignment for the "Creative Coding" course here at St. Thomas and decided to challenge myself, not just by creating a half decent looking calculator, but to also set a more fun background and make it so that the calculator itself was draggable. I did this with the intended thought that it would be of use if someone had another window open on top of the calculator window. While I can say that it still isn't perfect it gave me confidence to create websites and add in some cool features that make websites more interactive and engaging for the end user. 

2. Personal Portfolio.
   https://github.com/DaltonSchwanke/Portfolio
   
   This is my first real attempt at a portfolio website. It is a single page application that contains a nice welcome message, a projects section, experience section, about, and contact. The user can then navigate down the page and view the various projects and experiences via acyclic carousels. At the bottom of the page there is a contact form which the user can enter in their email, and message in order to contact me. This project never got completed, and I stopped developing it after I found a better way to create a portfolio which started development on December 4, 2024.
   
   While it wasn't my first attempt at a portfolio, it was the first half decent attempt at a portfolio and contained most of the required elements for a website. It taught me a lot about dynamic web pages and element creation within javascript as opposed to having static elements in a html page whether it's a template or not. On top of that it gave me a brief understanding of user authentification, something I percieve to be incredibly useful in some of my other projects. While this definitely isn't my best work it is worth mentioning that there are aspects of this website that's sole purpose was for experimentation. I learned how to layer a web page so that I could add in a animated background. I took time to learn about anchor tags and how to set scroll functions that would allow me to control the user's scrolling capabilities; In this instance, it makes it so that the user moves to the next section and there is true scrolling to any point on the y axis. So while it is sad to say this websites never made it on the web I still appreciate all the things that it taught me that I can use in my coming projects!
